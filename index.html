                    reflecting humanity’s contribution in bringing it into existence. 
                    But, to help the network find its own identity, it also searched for imagery of artificial intelligence.

                This piece was created by applying Neural Clash on a generative adversarial network (GAN). 
                In the first phase of training, the GAN was presented with thousands of images
                of human faces to learn how to generate a human face. 
                In the second phase of training, the GAN was trained using images resulting from a web
                search of “artificial intelligence.” The choice of when to switch from the first to the second phase of training, 
                as well as the selection of training image examples and hyperparameter values were made based on their ability 
                to produce creative results. The image selected to portray the AI’s self-portrait was the one that most strongly revealed the AI’s personality to the artist.

                     Neural Clash is a multi-phase training technique for simultaneous style and content
                     transfer across a chain of training sets. The training process is applicable to any neural network,
                     but in the creation of "Thrice Revealed", I focused on GANs, as they have been increasing popularity within the
                     art community.

                     <p class="brighttitle">
                     In Neural Clash, a neural net is trained in series of phases, with each phase introducing a new set of training data and a new set of hyperparameters. 
                     The decision of when to switch from one phase of training to the next,
                     as well as the selection of hyperparameter values, provides the artist with control over the creative aspects of the output.

                    <p class="brighttitle"> The creation of “Thrice Revealed” required a combination of two training phases: 
                    first, the network was trained on images of human faces, and in the second phase, it was trained on imagery of AI.
                    <br>For training on human faces, a <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan">StyleGAN</a> model was trained from scratch on high resolution portraits of 88 people that were photographed by the artist (720 images in total).
                    However, that number of data points was not enough to yield fine facial details required for this piece. 
                    Instead, a pre-trained StyleGAN model that was already pre-trained on 70,000 images of human faces at a 1024x1024 resolution was utilized.
                    For the imagery of AI, a set of images around the concept of “artificial intelligence” were manually put together from the collections of royalty free and public domain images 
                    online, tagged with “artificial intelligence,” “AI,” or “machine learning”. <br> A Python pipeline was developed to filter out noise and crop and convert training images
                    to the format required by the pre-trained model. Images with watermarks, text labels, or undesired patterns were manually removed from the dataset. 
                    The final dataset of AI imagery had 270 high-quality images in PNG format.

                    <p class="brighttitle"> Hyperparameters can be thought of as control knobs to steer training towards a given direction. 
                        We found the learning rate and the batch size the two most effective hyperparameters for producing interesting artistic results.
                        The learning rate corresponds to the speed at which the model converges toward learning the data present in the train set. 
                        The batch size defines the number of training examples that are passed to the model at each iteration. 
                        The learning rate in this project was set to 0.003 and the batch size was set to 32. The model was trained on a 4 GPU machine, 
                        and it took about five hours to complete one epoch.

                 <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p class="brighttitle"> While the learning rate corresponds to how fast the system will update its internal features to reflect 
                    the visual motifs in new dataset, the duration of training also impacts the extent to which features of a data set are learned. 
                    If a model is trained for too long on a new data set, it will eventually lose the features learned on previous data sets. 
                    After a single epoch, the internal features of the network are a blend of both facial features and features of AI imagery. 
                    After subsequent epochs, the facial features learned by the network become dominated by the newer features learned from AI imagery.

                    <p class="brighttitle"> Once training is complete, the creative skills of the artist come in to the play. A trained model can produce a never-ending stream of new images, but as German AI artist Mario Klingemann says, the tricky part “is knowing what to do with it all”.
                    In "Thrice Revealed", 300 samples were generated with different variations of truncation value (0.5 and 0.7) and through style mixing, different variations of a portrait were explore.

                 <p class="brighttitle"> Neural Clash was also applied to other visual subjects to understand whether it can produce similar, visually-interesting results. 
                 Following images are some examples of how Neural Clash fused human faces with visual motifs from imagery of antique rugs and cityscapes. 
                 <br>
                 Neural Clash has a lot of potential, and while my exploration was limited to blending faces with other visual motifs, I look forward to training new models with new imagery to see other kinds of style fusions that can be achieved.
